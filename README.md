A C compiler targeting LLVM IR or aarch64 assembly. 

This is not an optimising compiler, but it's certainly a compiling compiler, 
and that ought to be enough for anybody. Besides, LLVM can fix anything pathological on its own.

## Limitations 

- Pointers are assumed to be 64 bits. 
- The aarch backend can only target macOS because they use a slightly different calling convention.

## Stages

1. Source code
2. Token stream 
3. AST 
4. Resolved AST (names & types)
5. IR (static single assignment form)
6. LLVM IR or aarch64 assembly

There's also a VM that can directly run my IR for debugging the compiler.

## Libraries

- The lexer (converting source code to a stream of tokens) is generated by [Logos](https://crates.io/crates/logos). 
- LLVM (with the llvm-sys rust bindings).
